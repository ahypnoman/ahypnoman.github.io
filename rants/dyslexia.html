    <h1>A rant on Dyslexia (from a dyslexic)</h1>
    <p>(Before I begin, yes, I am diagnosed. I also personally know many, many other dyslexics and their opinions; I very much have the authority to speak on this. Of course, I do not speak on the behalf of all dyslexics, but I do not think many others would disagree).</p>
    <p>I have Dyslexia. It has affected me my entire life. I found ways around my problems with reading, but spelling continues to be a problem. Thankfully, I've recently found a hack-ish way around that: I've realised that I have near perfect spelling while typing (muscle memory? Maybe), so if I ever need to spell something I can 'air type' :P</p>
    <h1>Intro</h1>
    <p>The main point of writing this is to vent my frustrations on the countless misconceptions surrounding Dyslexia. I hate nothing more than people telling me what I feel and experience (or, what I should feel and experience), and my Dyslexia is no exception to this. People have told me it's a 'superpower', that it's a gift, or that it can be overcome. They have told me that I should feel happy that I have Dyslexia - that it defines my character. They have said that it makes me imaginative, or more spatially aware (e.g. Chess, Go, Othello), or gives me a better memory.</p>
    <p>No.</p>
    <p>Dyslexia does nothing good.</p>
    <h1>There are no positives</h1>
    <p>A common piece of evidence used for demonstrating the alleged 'good side' of Dyslexia is how a handful of creative fields (namely, architecture and design) have a high number of dyslexics active within them. Per se, this is true, however this fact is erroneously extrapolated into the idea that dyslexics are somehow inherently more creative than others. This is in now way true; it is not that we are more creative, it is that we are driven from other fields of work that are not accessible to our condition. Dyslexia doesn't give us vivid imaginations: it forces us to use them.</p>
    <p>The idea that dyslexics have a 'superpower' is a widely purported misconception, and one that has done more harm than good. Telling someone, particularly a child (as childhood is the context in which most of this kind of rhetoric first arises), that their inability to read to the standard that the majority of others can is actually good for them is creating a false hope and doing nothing but setting that individual on a path of disappointment and issues with self-esteem (which I and many other dyslexics that I know have experienced). It's painful having non-dyslexics constantly tell me how my brain works and how my disability is somehow a benefit. It would be horrible to say to a wheelchair user, "you can't (or have difficulties with) walking, but you're better than most people at turning wheels". Why is it not just as wrong to make a parallel statement to a dyslexic?</p>
    <p>The worst thing about this kind of sentiment is that it results in people withdrawing funding from research about Dyslexia. If such a sentiment continues we will never find the root cause of Dyslexia and by extension never be able to fix it (yes, I do think it's something that needs fixing. If it were possible I'd give anything to get rid of my dyslexia).</p>
    <h1>Comic Sans, the most ridiculous thing to happen to dyslexics</h1>
    <p>It's often stated by non-dyslexics that fonts like Comic Sans provide a benefit to us dyslexics. Some claim it's easier on our eyes, some claim it lets us read faster. A popular claim is that the irregularity and constant curves make it easier for us to read.</p>
    <p>Their claims are wrong and entirely unfounded: there is no scientific research to suggest that Comic Sans (or similar so-called 'dyslexic friendly fonts') provides anything for dyslexics. The irregularity is a burden and reduces clarity. Constant curves make it difficult to identify letters. Comic Sans' kerning is better termed keming. On top of all that, it's an abomination. This is probably the most harmful misconception about Dyslexia, and I strongly encourage you to correct anyone that makes this claim. It's painful and to an extent infantilising to have non-dyslexics shove this and other comically awful fonts down our throats once they know our diagnosis.</p>
    <p>That said, it must be stated that there are good fonts for us dyslexics. Simple and clear fonts like Helvetica and Roboto are good. Monospaced fonts help. One font, however, is far better and far more specialised: <a href="#lexendDemo">Lexend</a>. Its clarity and uniformity go far beyond any other fonts, it has perfect kerning, it is provided in variable width, it has been proven to improve reading speed in dyslexics by up to 20%, it looks great, and the best thing about it? It was designed specifically to undo the legacy of fonts like Comic Sans, to improve the lives of dyslexics. I suggest you visit their <a href="https://lexend.com">website</a> and research them yourself. They're really a great organisation.</p>
    <h1>We can write books</h1>
    <p>One of the most common misconceptions about dyslexia is the idea that we are unable to formulate complex or powerful texts, but this simply isn't the case. There are thousands of dyslexic authors. Less than non-dyslexics, but there are. It's undeniably harder for us to write in a broad sense, but we can be just as proficient in creating vivid ideas and scenery with words as others. There's little else to say on this point: Dyslexia affects one's ability to read and write, not competency in generating powerful verbalisations.</p>
    <h1>The letters don't move</h1>
    <p>The idea that dyslexics have some form of visual impairment that manifests in the form of letters and words appearing to physically move on the page is, for the most part, incorrect. Yes, some dyslexics experience this, but the vast majority do not. For most of us we simply struggle with the specific form of pattern recognition used for reading: for whatever reason we simply cannot process words on a page in the same way.</p>
    <p>As stated, some people are affected by this, and it is just as - if not more - detrimental to them. But it should really be classed as a separate condition: although the external manifestation is near identical, it's cause is distinct and so is the experience of the affected individual. There is no research to demonstrate that these are not distinct, and they should be treated distinctly until proven otherwise.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>If you're dyslexic, I hope you agree with this, and if not I encourage you to re-evaluate what people who don't experience our condition have told you (if you do agree, hopefully this acted as a sort of proxy-vent :P). If not, you now know the common misconceptions and can help the dyslexic community by not being a proponent of them.</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading (especially if you're dyslexic - proofreading this was torture for me, so I'm sorry I brought that upon you too XD).</p>
